## **IDE**

Platform.IO is used to edit and upload the firmware.

The underlying IDE (Atom, Visual Studio Code) does not matter.

However, this manual is based on Visual Studio code and may need to be adapted.

The installation of the IDE is described in the following link:

## **Download and open firmware**

The firmware can be downloaded from github as a ZIP file
[https://github.com/Blueforcer/AWTRIX](https://github.com/Blueforcer/AWTRIX)

Unzip the ZIP file with a suitable unpacker and open the folder in Visual Studio code.
