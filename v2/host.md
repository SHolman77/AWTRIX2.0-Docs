AWTRIX 2.0 can run on any platform, the only requirement is the support of Java8. It is a non-GUI application so you doesnt need an desktop enviroment. 

Download the current java  file
[AWTRIX Java application](#)

 and start it via command line or terminal 
 ```
 sudo java -jar awtrix.jar 
 ```


Shortly after the start the web interface can be called via http://awtrix_ip:7000.
