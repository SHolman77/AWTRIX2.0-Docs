**Devices**
-----------

To add your Yeelight devices, you can either use the “Discover Lights” function within Jeelight, or add them manually by IP address.

**To add them via “Discover Lights –**

*   This only works if your PC is connected via WLAN or your WiFi router supports multicast!
*   Click “Discover Lights” and the right panel will automatically locate your devices.
*   Click on a device to highlight it, then click “Use Selected” to add its IP address / name to the New Device fields.
*   Finally, click “Add Light” – Repeat these steps for all of your devices.

**To add them manually via IP address –**

*   Find the IP address for your Yeelight devices – you can do this through your router, or from within the Yeelight app (Device > Settings > Device Info > IP Address)
*   Type the IP address and a name into the New Device fields and click “Add Light” – Repeat for all of your devices.

**Ambilight**
-------------

**Set Zone:** Click a device to highlight it and then click “Set Zone”, this will open a draggable box on your screen. You can position this box to where you want it to get colour for your Yeelight. Smaller boxes use less CPU!

**Test Zones:** This will launch a full-screen video within the Jeelight app and allow you to instantly test your Ambilight settings.

**Speed:** How fast your Yeelights should react to color changes (in milliseconds). There is currently a known flickering issue with speeds below 300ms, but there is a firmware update coming soon from Yeelight that will fix it.

**Saturation Boost:** How much saturation should be added to the colors from your Yeelight. For example, blues on your screen will be really blue on your Yeelight with a high saturation. Warning: High saturations can turn whites into pink/red hue.

**Brightness:** Self-explanatory!

**Flashdetection:** Detects rapidly flashing lights on your screen, and adds a very brief white flash to rapid color changes – this adds a bit of immersion to gaming or action movies.

**Multithreading:** This is currently an experimental feature, it will make each light’s zone use its own CPU thread. 4 light zones = 4 CPU threads, for example. If you have a slow PC i recommend to turn Multithreading off.

**Nonstop:** This will continue to send commands to the Yeelights even with no color changes.

**Switch black to blue:** There is no 0 brightness in Yeelights, so color black on your screen makes the Yeelights go white. With this option enabled, your Yeelights will instead display a very dark, deep blue when black is detected, which is a bit more immersive during horror movies or very dark scenes in games.

**Use beta commands:** If you have the latest beta firmware from Yeelight, this will send additional commands to your Yeelights that eliminate flickering and make color transitions much smoother.

**Playground**
--------------

To enable Playground mode, you must click the **\>>Lights** button and enable the Yeelight devices you want to use.

**Brightness:** Self-explanatory.

**Temperature:** Adjust the temperature of your Yeelights from 1700k to 6500k.

**RGB Input:** Manually enter RGB values to change the color of your Yeelights.

**MouseFlow:** Jeelight will follow your mouse cursor and change your Yeelights! Very cool effect for painting in Photoshop or similar. After clicking MouseFlow button, press + on your NumPad to start tracking, and – to disable.

**Music:** Enables “Music Mode” for your Yeelights – currently will only process sound from a microphone, and is based on sound amplitude. Recommended to have a good microphone that is not very sensitive to ambient noises.

**Effectcreator:**
------------------

To enable effect editor, click the **\>>Lights** button and enable the Yeelight devices you want to use.

This is a pretty advanced mode that will allow you to completely customize the flow of your Yeelights. You can add color changes and brightness levels in millisecond durations.

This allows you to create, for example, a warm glowing and flickering fireplace type of scene. The best way to figure this all out is to just experiment a lot with it.

**Scenes:**
-----------

Here you can set up your own scenes. In the effects list you find all your created Effects. You can also download some from the Community in the Effect Browser. Drag an effect from the list and drop it in the green zone of the desired Light. You can remove an effect with rightclick. Now press play and your Lights will start the effect. While playing you can close JeeLight because the Light will do it for its own. You can check “Play random” so each light will start with a random delay. Note: Due to some factors (Wifi delays etc), sometimes do not start at the same time. Just click “Play” again.

If you’ve created a fancy effect. Share it with the community and **upload** it

### **FAQ / Troubleshooting**

**Q: My Yeelights stopped responding to Jeelight! How to fix?**

**A:** Try closing Jeelight, open the Yeelight app on your phone and turn your lights off and on again. Then re-open the Jeelight app. If that doesn’t work, try manually power-cycling your Yeelights from your physical light switches.

**Q: Ambilight doesn’t work while gaming! Whats going on?**

**A:** Jeelight can only monitor what is happening on your desktop, it cannot monitor true full-screen apps. To use Ambilight feature while gaming, try changing your game to a borderless or maximized window mode.
