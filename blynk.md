## **Remote control with the BLYNK app**

AWTRIX can be remotely controlled via the BLYNK app. All settings are retained after restarting AWTRIX.

The app is available for iOS and Android. 
With the following link or QR-Code the BLYNK configuration can be loaded by me. [http://tinyurl.com/y9fo3wfl](http://tinyurl.com/y9fo3wfl)
It can then be changed as required.

(Attention: Since many controls are needed, it is necessary to get Energy via In-App purchase. I recommend to buy at least 5000 to cover subsequent updates).
In the app you will also find the API key which must be entered in config.json.
Unfortunately, updates do not automatically update the app. The new BLYNK layout is kept up to date in the Facebook group and here.
