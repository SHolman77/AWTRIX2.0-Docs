## **3D-Print**

The housing can be created with a 3D printer. The necessary files can be downloaded from Thingyverse.[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2791276](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2791276)

The 3D objects are already aligned as they should be printed to require as little support material as possible. Please print the **LED grid in black**, otherwise the "pixels" are not clearly separated, as they shine through the material.
**Recommended print settings:**

* 0.2 mm layer resolution

* 20% infill

* Support from the bed

* 45-55 mm/s

## **Assembly**

First the 2 parts of the LED-grid are glued together on the inside. Grease the flat side with a glue stick and glue on strong drawing paper (approx. 190 g/mÂ²) and cut to size. Same with the 2 parts of the front frame.
Insert the rear housing parts into each other and check that they fit perfectly. They should only be able to be plugged together with light pressure. If the voltage is too high, the housing may later bend due to the heat of the LEDs. Sandpaper is a good tool to make everything fit if the printer is not perfectly adjusted. If everything fits, the housing parts can also be glued together.

After that the electronics can be used (in the future there may be a PCB to make it a bit cleaner).

Place the LED grid on the front and insert the matrix upside down, it should fit perfectly into the groove. Now the housing can be pressed onto the grid. Turn the whole thing once and attach the frame.
